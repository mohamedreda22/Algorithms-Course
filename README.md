## Introduction
You will find the source code and solutions I wrote while learning algorithms in my Algorithms Course in this repository.
Algorithms are a fundamental part of computer science and play a crucial role in solving complex problems efficiently.
I created this repository to showcase my progress and share my knowledge with others interested in algorithms.

## Course Contents
The course covers a wide range of algorithms, including but not limited to:
- Sorting Algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- Searching Algorithms (e.g., Binary Search)
- Graph Algorithms (e.g., Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search)
- Dynamic Programming (e.g., Fibonacci Sequence, Knapsack Problem)
- and more!
